        tweets: {
            1: "there’s immense beauty in everyday things, something under your nose bc of our habitual filtering of the world through states of being & perceived relevance. in expanding awareness there’s much more to be appreciated including beauty…even that of just being here & now, it's self",
            2: "is being called sexy so much a compliment? perhaps we know not, “you wield traits that provoke primal reproductive urges, i find you lust-worthy”. beauty—true beauty’s that which’s cultivated through virtue & will of the soul. fleshy busty transience vs. eye sparkly transcendence",
            3: "many men grow up viewing women as magical. most of this’s delusion but a tiny part’s seeing divine potentiality; beauty of feminine soul that women CAN live up to. but reality’s most won't & will deeply resent one w any expectation. masochistically at best & sadistically at worst",
            4: "for skin care i’ve learned most from secrets of incel’s research. dermanator2 & tretinoin are the biggest cosmetic levers, jewels among waste. all needed outside standard routine (cleanser, serum, moisturizer + weekly aztec face mask). ordinary brand’s ofc a great goto for basics",
            5: "emu oil…still no one talks about emu oil, it has yet to become popular in any community i’m aware of. it puts coconut oil to shame, a wonder for whole body and face the same. also an LLT device is ofc another powerful must-have tool in the arsenal. but srsly, try emu oil already",
            6: "beautiful ambiance’s harmony of all order no stone unturned in all conducive multi-feedback loops; health, aesthetics & higher significance. symbolic decor, decorum, aromatics, fine organic materials, graceful loving utterances. nourishing serene dwelling most importantly in mind",
            7: "resin on a brazier, decisive color scheme, beloved company, cleanliness. ragas, classical, gregorian chants, acapella choir. sincerity, sweet smiles, yielding thoughtful-ness, peaceful laughter. plenty silent time, sunshine, hq nutrition. patience, humility, forgiveness, healing",
            8: "designate space for things, set things in their place, create a space, hide in a little corner. find a getaway spot, your own private place. but above all & regardless of any, make your psyche the place of beauty & bliss…the ultimate getaway",
            9: "the thing about utilitarianism is beauty is a utility, the thing about minimalism is things should be discarded or stripped away that don’t add beauty",
            10: "radiant food; juicy & colorful, produce the same of you. foods that hold things together help your skin & body’s integrity. organs aid corresponding ones +. fresh (unadulterated/raw) food keeps your body exuberant & teeming. artificial food leaves your health grappling for life",
            11: "most know matchymatchy-ness’s not always sartorially elegant: “blue shirt, blue shoes, blue belt, blue hat, whew ima skittle!”. theme or color palette is the mode to think in, skin tone’s included & you could say the most beautiful part. dressing w it in mind’s always a good idea",
            12: "terrestrial looks have their place but not only is it not what matters, over fascination with them has the potential to deter you from true beauty; what does matter",
            13: "there’s apocrypha entailing jesus taking on his vesture that’s a piercing light making viewing him unbearable for his disciples present. the christic glow’s unmistakable, magnanimous, pure; shining with the love of christ indwells you w a light that can grow brighter & brighter",
            14: `definitive prescriptions for beauty. choose one or all, doesn’t matter: 

            - the 7 heavenly virtues
            - the 8 fold path
            - the 6 paramitas
            - the 42 laws of maat
            - the 10 commandments
            - shari’a/the 75 good manners
            - the 5 niyamas`

        tweets: {
            1: "a special place’s in hell for pharisaic spiritual/religious zealots. professor of faith devoid of the genuine thing. vain “knowledge” seeker (“know nothing at alls”). sanctimoniously ignorant. sectarian fool. non-seek, establish, or refining practicers critics of all but themself",
            2: "“with power comes responsibility” extends to how you empower your soul through the development of your spiritual walk, if you veer too much it seems to me that you do so with higher velocity & stakes. after all, many demons are fallen angels",
            3: "being eSoTEriC & delving into the occult is extremely often sought for identity or aesthetic. when done w these motives it becomes the ensured hellfire-laden endeavors of demons; exactly resembling the stigma that these things carry. the practitioner will not be able to see this",
            4: "there was a saint who saw Christ appear to him in a vision. he said he was not worthy to see him, then “Christ” disappeared - it was a demon appearing as him, and the demon was repulsed by his humility. an angel then praised him for his humility",
            5: "jesus's table flip in a temple bc of it being made marketplace laments making trade of the sacred. not excluded from this wide span is sex, miracles, divination, tarot, astrology, etc. beware of spiritual profiteering. learn the right things yourself. ensure they’re done properly",
            6: "the perceived realization of enlightenment from psychedelic drugs is a chthonic ploy of precisely false profundity & negative anti-enlightenment. it is certainly a spiritual experience…a demoniac one",
            7: "the non-righteous are away from God, the non-righteous who think they are close to God or spiritual, are often further",
            
            8: `“spiritual ego”: brags of supernatural experiences or revelations 
            \n
            true spiritual self: completely silent about them outside of rarer appropriate most selfless circumstance`,
            9: `“spiritual ego”: thinks itself special. especially due to “calling”, “knowledge”, “clairvoyance”, etc. 
            \n
            true spiritual self: knows it’s not. if ever the thought occurs recognizes it & is not lead astray`,
            10: `“spiritual ego”: mistakes externalities i.e. magic tools & trinkets, trips to different temples & countries, material fortune, or drugs to have criticality
            \n
            true spiritual self: knows the kingdom of heaven is inside you`,
            11: `“spiritual ego”: postures & fancies itself like a church, religious, spiritual, esoteric, or occult person 
            \n
            true spiritual self: acts like no one in particular`,
            12: `“spiritual ego”: high mighty. finds itself more advanced than others 
            \n
            true spiritual self: humble. has compassion for others`
